	<p>I first went there with my Writing Girls, a group of three fellow English majors that I bonded with in Siobhan Vivian's Writing Youth Literature class. Shannon, Paige and Katy were in the trenches with me, as we were (and still are) writing our first full-length fantasy novels. They became my favorite and most valuable advisors, coaching me through those dark hours when the only beauty I could see in my book was in its font. We would meet anywhere to work on our stories: Hillman Library, Dobra Tea house, the floor of someone's South Oakland apartment. But this time, we went to Biddle's.</p>

	<p>We found a spot to sit on the sunny wooden porch out front, tucked beneath several large, friendly trees and surrounded by a wooden fence for privacy. Ten or more metal tables and mismatched chairs were scattered about, mostly occupied by patrons sipping tea or munching on pastries. There were long brances of driftwood hung along the fence's interior with faces carved into them for decoration. The shop's front was open to the porch, a purple garage door rolled up during the day to allow visiors to enter and exit as they pleased. Through this opening, I could spy their entire menu, more seats and boothes, and a wall of buddhist and hindu masks in the very back of the store. My hippie mom would love it.</p>
	<p>As we sat down and opened our laptops to begin to work, I smiled and counted the dogs that were curled beneath their owners tables. Five. And then I saw them. Huddled between the feet of their owner who was happily reading a book. Two bunnies. On leashes. Yes, you heard that right. Of course I immediatley went over to talk to the owner and pet them, and was able to take this gem of a photo. </p>

	<p>Since that first memorable visit, I have returned to Biddle's Escape several times, falling more and more in love with their positive atmosphere, their quirky patrons, and their amazing grilled cheese. Each time I visit, I think of my Writing Girls, two who have now graduated, one who is in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Each time I visit, I remember not to give up on my novel, which is now more than a year old. </p>
	<p>Thanks to Biddle's Escape, I not only have a lovely place do homework and to take friends, but also have a wonderful topic to write about for the sake of this webpage, and encourage all my readers to go and explore it. </p>
	<p>Maybe you'll even pet a rabbit on a leash. </p>
